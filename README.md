[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
A computer vision playground to try and test end to end(test to deploy) computer vision pipeline. 


App 1 : 

- Name : Process videos for object detection using Tensorflow

- Models currently supported* : 

|                |DB Code                          |Model                         |

|2          |ssdiv2            |ssd_inception_v2_coco_2017_11_17           |


due to heroku space limitations.

More model support coming soon. Status passing, pytest with code 5. Import requires tensorflow model folder inside codes directory, however if it is available in your path then ou can directly link to it.
